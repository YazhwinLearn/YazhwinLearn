      <h1> Overview AV</h1>
      <p><b> An autonomous vehicle</b> is a self-driving automobile equipped with sensors, cameras, 
        and artificial intelligence algorithms to perceive and navigate its surroundings. These vehicles can interpret traffic signs, 
        detect obstacles, and make real-time decisions to ensure safe driving. They aim to reduce accidents, traffic congestion, and 
        provide increased mobility for people with disabilities or limited access to transportation. Autonomous vehicles are poised to 
        revolutionize transportation by offering efficient, convenient, and potentially cost-effective alternatives to traditional driving. 
        However, challenges remain regarding regulatory frameworks, cybersecurity, and public acceptance.</p>
