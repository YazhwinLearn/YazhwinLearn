      <h1> OVERVIEW  OF BIM</h1>
      <p><b>BIM (Building Information Modeling) is a revolutionary approach to the 
        design, construction, and management of buildings and infrastructure projects. 
        It involves creating and managing digital representations of physical and 
        functional characteristics of places. BIM facilitates collaboration among 
        stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle, enabling better decision-making, 
        improved efficiency, and reduced costs. By integrating 3D modeling with data and
        information, BIM enhances visualization, simulation, and analysis, leading to 
        more sustainable and resilient built environments. It has become a fundamental 
        tool in the architecture, engineering, and construction industries, revolutionizing 
        the way projects are conceived, designed, constructed, and operated.</p>
