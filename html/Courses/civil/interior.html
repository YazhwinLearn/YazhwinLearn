      <h1> OVERVIEW  OF BIM</h1>
      <p><b>Interior design is the art and science of enhancing interior spaces to 
        achieve a more aesthetically pleasing and functional environment. It involves 
        creatively utilizing space, color, texture, furniture, and accessories to 
        create harmonious and inviting interiors. Interior designers consider the needs 
        and preferences of clients while incorporating design principles to create 
        spaces that are both practical and visually appealing. Their expertise extends 
        to residential, commercial, and institutional settings, ensuring that spaces are 
        not only beautiful but also conducive to their intended purpose. Through 
        thoughtful planning and attention to detail, 
        interior design transforms spaces into personalized and inspiring environments.</p>
